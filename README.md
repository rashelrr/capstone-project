# About
Capstone project for the course *Developing Accessible User Interfaces*. In class, we learned about how difficult it is for dynamic websites 
(websites with data that changes) to be accessible to some users. Specifically, those who rely on screen readers. 
Because dynamically changing content may not be reflected to screen readers, users cannot access the content. Thus, my teammate and I created a 
website that teaches developers how to make dynamic content accessible by providing interactive examples.


## Built With
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

To properly understand the improvements shown through the examples, use a screen reader extension. 
[Here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screen-reader/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn) is the one I used.
